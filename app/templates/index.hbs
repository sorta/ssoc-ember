    <h3 class="h2">Me</h3>

    <p>
      I've learned a lot in my {{this.years.devSpan}} years as a professional web developer. In that time, I've worked on
      many systems of varying complexity, and I've become skilled in a wide variety of technologies and techniques.
      But I also recognize that there are still (and probably always will be) things for me to learn and improve upon.
      I love learning, so this actually works out well for me. One of my main goals as a developer is to always strive
      for continuous improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      But skills aren't all that I have going for me. I also have a passion for web development in general, and front-end
      development in particular. I regularly read articles and listen to podcasts to help myself stay current.
      I care very much about the quality of things that I build.
